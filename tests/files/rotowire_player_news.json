That being said, only two other players scored in double figures for Milwaukee -- Khris Middleton with 19 and Matthew Dellavedova with 12. Antetokounmpo's struggles from the charity stripe in Game 6 aside, he ultimately had not only a coming out party this series, but for the whole season. He finished the 2016-17 campaign averaging 22.9 points, 8.8 rebounds, 5.4 assists, 1.9 blocks and 1.6 steals while shooting 52.1 percent from the field across 35.6 minutes per game -- certainly worthy of Most Improved Player consideration.",

Ibaka also feasted on Milwaukee's lack of perimeter shooting throughout the series, averaging 2.4 blocks coming into Thursday's contest, where he swatted two shots. Depending on how coach Dwane Casey addresses the starting lineup during the Raptors' next series against the Cavaliers, he could be faced up against a tough offensive opponent in Kevin Love. Though, if coach Casey opts to keep rolling with Ibaka at center, he could be matched up against Tristan Thompson. Regardless, Ibaka will be forced to protect the glass, as both players are top-tier rebounding presences. Game 1 tips off Monday.",

He underwent treatment on Thursday and will travel with the team ahead of Game 6 on Friday, but his status remains uncertain at this time. With Ian Mahinmi (calf) also expected to be sidelined, the Wizards could have some serious depth issues in the frontcourt, so look for Smith to do everything he can to get on the court. Another update should be available once Smith is able to test the calf out during pregame warmups.",

The 32-year-old played in just 46 games last season, but barring a signifiant setback in his recovery, he should be ready for basketball activity before the 2017-18 opener. Even if rehab goes as planned, however, Noah has served just eight games of a 20-game drug suspension that was handed down March 25. Due to the injury history, remaining suspension and generally declining production -- 5.0 points, 8.8 rebounds last season -- Noah likely won't be off the board until the later part of deeper fantasy drafts next season.",

Though the Jazz restricted Gobert's minutes, his presence in the frontcourt helped give the team a needed lift with All-Star Gordon Hayward exiting early with an illness.  Gobert was resting down the stretch Sunday as the Jazz look to avoid overworking him, but he could be ready to take back a 30-plus-minute role in Tuesday's Game 5.",
